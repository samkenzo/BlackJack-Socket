Integration Report: Networked Blackjack Game
1. Overview
The project evolved from two separate modules—a server handling game logic and a client handling a basic UI—to a fully integrated networked blackjack game. The main goal was to replace console-based interactions with JSON messages over a TCP connection, allowing remote gameplay via a graphical user interface built with Tkinter.

2. Server Code Modifications
A. Integration of Full Proof Blackjack Logic
Game Classes Introduced:
The server code now incorporates classes for Card, Deck, Dealer, Player, and BlackjackGame.
Card & Deck:
A Card class represents an individual playing card with methods to return its value. The Deck class manages a full deck of cards, provides shuffling functionality, and deals cards.
Dealer & Player:
The Dealer and Player classes hold each participant's hand, calculate scores, and represent the game state. The Player class also tracks the player's money and bet amounts.
BlackjackGame:
This class wraps the game logic by initializing the deck, handling initial deals, processing player actions (hit), running the dealer’s turn (stay), and evaluating the final game outcome. The logic for adjusting scores when Aces are involved and for payout calculations is embedded in these methods.
B. Conversion from Console to Network Commands
Command Handling:
The server’s interactive console calls (input() and print()) were removed. Instead, the server now listens for JSON messages from each connected client.

Supported Commands:
"set_nick": Receives the player's nickname and initializes a new BlackjackGame instance.
"bet": Accepts a bet amount, validates it against the player's available money, and starts the initial deal.
"hit": Adds a new card to the player's hand and checks if the player busts (score exceeds 21).
"stay": Triggers the dealer’s turn, evaluates the game result, and computes payouts.
"new_game": Resets the game state while preserving the player's remaining money.
Message Delimiting:
All JSON messages sent from the server now include a newline (\n) as a delimiter. This ensures that the client can reliably parse complete messages from the TCP stream.

C. Sending Game State and Results
JSON Responses:
The server sends structured JSON messages to update the client about the game state:
"info" messages provide feedback such as confirmation of nickname and available funds.
"game_state" messages include the player’s hand, score, dealer’s visible card, and the player’s remaining money.
"game_over" messages communicate final outcomes, including both the player's and dealer’s complete hands, scores, and the result message (win, loss, tie).
Error handling returns JSON messages with type "error" to notify the client of any invalid commands or issues.
3. Client Code Modifications
A. Enhanced Graphical User Interface (GUI)
Tkinter-Based Layout:
The client’s UI has been overhauled to provide a user-friendly experience. Key UI elements include:
Labels: Displaying game information, scores, dealer’s card, and result messages.
Input Widgets:
A dialog box prompts the user for their nickname.
A dedicated entry field and button allow the user to place a bet.
Control Buttons:
Buttons for in-game actions (Hit, Stay, and New Game) are enabled or disabled based on game state. For example, the Hit and Stay buttons are disabled until a bet is placed and the game state is received from the server.
B. Communication Improvements
Message Sending:
All client commands are now sent as JSON strings appended with a newline character. This ensures consistency with the server’s expectations and allows proper message framing.

Message Receiving:
The client wraps its socket using a file-like object (makefile) and reads messages line by line. This approach guarantees that each complete JSON message is parsed correctly even if the TCP stream is fragmented.

C. UI and Network Interaction Flow
Initial Setup:
On startup, the client connects to the server.
A simple dialog (using tkinter.simpledialog) requests the user’s nickname and sends a "set_nick" command.
Placing a Bet:
Once the server acknowledges the nickname with an "info" message, the bet entry is enabled.
The user enters a bet amount and clicks “Place Bet,” which sends a "bet" command.
Gameplay Interaction:
As the game state updates from the server ("game_state" messages), the UI displays the player’s hand, score, and dealer’s visible card.
The user then makes decisions by clicking the Hit or Stay buttons.
Game Conclusion and Restart:
When the game concludes, a "game_over" message is processed, and the UI shows the final results.
The New Game button is enabled to allow the user to restart the game while retaining their current balance.
4. Conclusion
The integration transformed a console-based blackjack game into a networked multiplayer system with a rich GUI interface. The key changes include:

Server Side:
Incorporation of full game logic classes, transition from console I/O to JSON-based messaging, and robust handling of player commands (set_nick, bet, hit, stay, new_game).

Client Side:
Upgrading the UI using Tkinter to include dialogs for nickname and bet input, dynamic button enabling/disabling, and proper handling of incoming JSON messages with message delimiting.

This restructured architecture not only allows for remote gameplay but also makes the codebase more modular and maintainable. Each component now clearly separates game logic, network communication, and user interface, paving the way for future enhancements such as multiplayer games or more sophisticated UI interaction
